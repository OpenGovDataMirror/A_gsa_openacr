# Example OpenACR

All HTML reports are displayed using the [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov). That framework is contained in the /openACR/uswds/ directory.

The index.html file provides a data table output for the reports. To add a new OpenACR file to the data table an entry to the `dataSet` variable will need to be added in the `reports.js`.

## Other-git-repos.md

Vendors and authors of ACRs may want to include a link to their central git repository rather than sending them to the GSA. It is much easier if ACRs are made publicly available and downloadable via an open git repository.

## Validating YAML files and creating HTML/Markdown

See [OpenACR section in CLI documentation](/docs/CLI.md#openacr).
