Licences of works that we leverage are listed in the `licenses.txt` file. This software is all open source, and we are listing it here for people who want to investigate specific packages used.

We keep this file up-to-date. When new packages are added the `licenses.txt` file needs to be updated. Simply run `npm run generate-license-report` from the command line and commit the changes.

See [README](../README.md) for more details.
